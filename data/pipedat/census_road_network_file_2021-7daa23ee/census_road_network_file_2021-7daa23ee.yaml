  description: The 2021 Census Road Network File includes the unique identifier, DGUID,
    name and type for each side of a street arc (where applicable) for provinces and
    territories, and census subdivisions. In the 2021 Census Road Network File, streets

  description: The road network from the Census 2021 road network file [@statisticscanada2021a;
    statisticscanada2021b] was rasterized as a 1 $km^2$ resolution then integrated
    in the study grid to obtain a raster of the distribution of the Canadian road
    network. The distance of the centroid of each cell in the grid to the closest
    road was then measured to obtain an assessment of the distance to the closest
    road across Canada.
