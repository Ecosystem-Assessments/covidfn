    <br> According to Statistics Canada housing suitability *"refers to whether a
    private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National
    Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is, whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for
    the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living
    in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms, as calculated
    using the NOS. Housing suitability assesses the required number of bedrooms for
    a household based on the age, sex, and relationships among household members.
    An alternative variable, persons per room, considers all rooms in a private dwelling
    and the number of household members. Housing suitability and the National Occupancy
    Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing
    Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies."* Housing
    suitability was assessed as the proportion of households in a census division
    considered as not suitable. <br> Dwelling condition refers to whether the dwelling
    is in need of repairs. Acceptability of dwelling condition was assessed as the
    proportion of households in a census division considered as needing major repairs.
    <br> According to Statistics Canada, acceptable housing *"refers to whether a
    household meets each of the three indicator thresholds established by the Canada
    Mortgage and Housing Corporation for housing adequacy, suitability and affordability.
    Housing indicator thresholds are defined as follows: 1) adequate housing is reported
    by their residents as not requiring any major repairs; 2) affordable housing has
    shelter costs less than 30% of total before-tax household income;  3) suitable
    housing has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households
    according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS), conceived by the Canada Mortgage
    and Housing Corporation and provincial and territorial representatives. Acceptable
    housing identifies which thresholds the household falls below, if any. Housing
    that is adequate in condition, suitable in size and affordable is considered to
    be acceptable."* Here, acceptable housing was assessed as the proportion of households
    in a census division that was below any of the thresholds of adequacy, affordability
    or suitability.'
