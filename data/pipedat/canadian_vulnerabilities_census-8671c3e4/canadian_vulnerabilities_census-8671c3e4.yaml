            Data from the 2021 Census of Population [@statisticscanada2021a] was used to select relevant population indicators as proxies of social vulnerabilities. The indicators were then joined to the {geos} and subsequently integrated in the study grid. The selected indicators are: <br>

                <td>The Gini coefficient is a number between zero and one that measures the relative degree of inequality in the distribution of income. The coefficient would register zero (minimum inequality) for a population in which each person received exactly the same adjusted household income and it would register a coefficient of one (maximum inequality) if one person received all the adjusted household income and the rest received none. Even though a single Gini coefficient value has no simple interpretation, comparisons of the level over time or between populations are very straightforward: the higher the coefficient, the higher the inequality of the distribution.</td>

More specifically, the thresholds represented income levels at which these families or persons were expected to spend 20 percentage points or more of their after‑tax income than average on food, shelter and clothing.
