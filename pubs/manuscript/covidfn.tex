\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The objective of this article was to explore how rates of COVID-19
outcomes during the pandemic were linked to indicators of social
vulnerability (\emph{e.g.} employment, income, dwelling condition)
across Canada. Our specific goals were to 1) characterize the spatial
distribution of social vulnerabilities across Canada, and 2) explore the
relationship between social vulnerabilities and rates of COVID-19
infections and deaths during the pandemic. Our goal with this assessment
is identify readily available indicators of social vulnerability and
target those that should be alleviated to improve our response to
another pandemic in the future.

The Timeline of COVID-19 in Canada (CovidTimelineCanada) is intended to
be the definitive source for data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in
Canada. In addition to making available the ready-to-use datasets, this
repository also acts as a hub for collaboration on expanding and
improving the availability and quality of COVID-19 data in Canada. This
repository is maintained by the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group
and is one component of the What Happened? COVID-19 in Canada project.
\end{quote}

This dataset provides daily data on COVID-19 infections and deaths for
99 Canadian health regions throughout the pandemic. We selected data
spanning from the onset of the pandemic in Canada (2020-01-15 in the
data) until 2023-05-17.

\textbf{\emph{Note that the end date should be discussed and decided
upon together. Some things to consider for this decision: when certain
provinces began phasing out reporting at the level of health regions
(see
https://github.com/ccodwg/CovidTimelineCanada/blob/main/docs/data\_sources/hr\_reporting.md),
and the advent of rapid testing.}}

\paragraph{2021 Census of Population}\label{census-of-population}}

Data from the 2021 Census of Population \citep{statisticscanada2021a}
was used to select relevant population indicators as proxies of social
vulnerabilities. The indicators were then joined to the census
cartographic divisions boundary files for 2021
\citep{statisticscanada2022f, statisticscanada2022} and subsequently
integrated in the study grid. The selected indicators were:

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Gini index on adjusted household total income}: \emph{``The
  Gini coefficient is a number between zero and one that measures the
  relative degree of inequality in the distribution of income. The
  coefficient would register zero (minimum inequality) for a population
  in which each person received exactly the same adjusted household
  income and it would register a coefficient of one (maximum inequality)
  if one person received all the adjusted household income and the rest
  received none. Even though a single Gini coefficient value has no
  simple interpretation, comparisons of the level over time or between
  populations are very straightforward: the higher the coefficient, the
  higher the inequality of the distribution.''}
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{P90/P10 ratio on adjusted household after-tax income}:
  \emph{``The P90/P10 ratio is a measure of inequality. It is the ratio
  of the 90th and the 10th percentile of the adjusted household
  after-tax income. The 90th percentile means 90\% of the population has
  income that falls below this threshold. The 10th percentile means 10\%
  of the population has income that falls below this threshold.''}
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Prevalence of low income based on the Low-income measure,
  after tax (LIM-AT) (\%)}: \emph{``The Lowâ€‘income measure, after tax,
  refers to a fixed percentage (50\%) of median adjusted afterâ€‘tax
  income of private households. The household afterâ€‘tax income is
  adjusted by an equivalence scale to take economies of scale into
  account. This adjustment for different household sizes reflects the
  fact that a household's needs increase, but at a decreasing rate, as
  the number of members increases.''}
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Prevalence of low income based on the Low-income cut-offs,
  after tax (LICO-AT) (\%)}: \emph{``The Lowâ€‘income cutâ€‘offs, after tax
  refer to income thresholds, defined using 1992 expenditure data, below
  which economic families or persons not in economic families would
  likely have devoted a larger share of their afterâ€‘tax income than
  average to the necessities of food, shelter and clothing. More
  specifically, the thresholds represented income levels at which these
  families or persons were expected to spend 20 percentage points or
  more of their afterâ€‘tax income than average on food, shelter and
  clothing. These thresholds have been adjusted to current dollars using
  the allâ€‘items Consumer Price Index (CPI).''}
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Indigenous identity}: \emph{``Indigenous identity refers to
  whether the person identified with the Indigenous peoples of Canada.
  This includes those who identify as First Nations (North American
  Indian), MÃ©tis and/or Inuk (Inuit), and/or those who report being
  Registered or Treaty Indians (that is, registered under the Indian Act
  of Canada), and/or those who have membership in a First Nation or
  Indian band. Aboriginal peoples of Canada (referred to here as
  Indigenous peoples) are defined in the Constitution Act, 1982, Section
  35 (2) as including the Indian, Inuit and MÃ©tis peoples of Canada.''}

Data from housing suitability \citep{statisticscanada2022c}, dwelling
condition \citep{statisticscanada2022d}, and acceptable housing
\citep{statisticscanada2022e} of the 2021 Census of Population
\citep{statisticscanada2021a} were also joined with the 2021 Census
cartographic division boundary file {[}\citet{statisticscanada2022};
statisticscanada2022f{]}.

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Housing suitability}: According to Statistics Canada, housing
  suitability \emph{``refers to whether a private household is living in
  suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard
  (NOS); that is, whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size
  and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living
  in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms, as
  calculated using the NOS. Housing suitability assesses the required
  number of bedrooms for a household based on the age, sex, and
  relationships among household members. An alternative variable,
  persons per room, considers all rooms in a private dwelling and the
  number of household members. Housing suitability and the National
  Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada
  Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with
  provincial housing agencies.''} Housing suitability was assessed as
  the proportion of households in a census division considered as not
  suitable.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Dwelling condition}: Dwelling condition refers to whether the
  dwelling is in need of repairs. Acceptability of dwelling condition
  was assessed as the proportion of households in a census division
  considered as needing major repairs.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Acceptable housing}: According to Statistics Canada,
  acceptable housing \emph{``refers to whether a household meets each of
  the three indicator thresholds established by the Canada Mortgage and
  Housing Corporation for housing adequacy, suitability and
  affordability. Housing indicator thresholds are defined as follows: 1)
  adequate housing is reported by their residents as not requiring any
  major repairs; 2) affordable housing has shelter costs less than 30\%
  of total before-tax household income; 3) suitable housing has enough
  bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according
  to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS), conceived by the Canada
  Mortgage and Housing Corporation and provincial and territorial
  representatives. Acceptable housing identifies which thresholds the
  household falls below, if any. Housing that is adequate in condition,
  suitable in size and affordable is considered to be acceptable.''}
  Here, acceptable housing was assessed as the proportion of households
  in a census division that was below any of the thresholds of adequacy,
  affordability or suitability.

The road network from the Census 2021 road network file
{[}\citet{statisticscanada2021a}; statisticscanada2021b{]} was
rasterized as a 1 \(km^2\) resolution then integrated in the study grid
to obtain a raster of the distribution of the Canadian road network. The
distance of the centroid of each cell in the grid to the closest road
was then measured to obtain an assessment of the distance to the closest
road across Canada.

\hypertarget{open-database-of-healthcare-facilities}{%
\paragraph{Open Database of Healthcare
Facilities}\label{open-database-of-healthcare-facilities}}

The location of healthcare facilities available in the Open Database of
Healthcare Facilities {[}ODHF; \citet{statisticscanada2020};
\citet{statisticscanada2020a}{]} were used to assess the distance to the
closest healthcare facility. Facilities were divided between critical
and longterm care using the classifications available in the ODHF.
Hospitals and ambulatory health care services were considered as
critical care facilities, while nursing and residential care facilities
were considered as longterm care facilities.
